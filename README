My dad used to have a paper copy of his thesis in our garage, but he lost it in a flood.  I managed to get a scan of the dissertation itself off of microfilm held by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I'm hoping to digitize it into proper LaTeX for his birthday this year so he can have a real copy.

This repository contains a microfilm scan (in PDF) of my Dad's thesis, as well as a collection of LaTeX source files and clipped images that will hopefully assemble into the same document.
